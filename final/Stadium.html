	<p>At & T Stadium was finished in 2009 and can hold 80,000 people sitting.  However, it can hold over 100,000 people standing throughout the stadium.  The stadium can also be referred  as "Jerry World" since he funded the majority of it.</p>

	<p>Like previously mentioned, the stadium cost over $1 billion dollars  making it the most expensive sports stadium.  When it first opened Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, and other great players had the honor of being part of the ribbon cutting ceremony.</p>

	<p> Almost every team has a mascot and Dallas is no exception, most people have seen him before.  However, Rowdy was not his original  name, in the 90s he was called "Big D" but was changed in 96.</p>
