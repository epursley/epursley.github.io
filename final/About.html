	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>The question I always get is why did I become a Dallas fan? The answer  to that is I'm not exactly sure.  I do know that I started like them about nine years ago watching Tony Romo calling him "Sal" and the Cowboys the "Stars". Although going down to see them play is fun, it's also nice to have a boy weekend with my dad.</p>

	<p>Then for the last eight years my dad and I have a tradition to go down to Dallas to see a game and spend the weekend together.  If they are ever playing close enough for us to drive to a game we try and see them.  We've seen them play the browns and steelers, both of which they have won</p>

	<p>After high school I plan on attending Baldwin Wallace for finance.  I chose this school because it is a relatively small school which I liked.  They also have a good business program which is great for me. </p>

	<p>Fun Fact about me that most people don't know. I was adopted from South Korea when I was six months old.</p>
