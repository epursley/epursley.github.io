	</p> The Dallas Cowboys officially became a franchised team on January 28, 1960. This was after the college draft which was the first time an expansion team played without the draft.  However, it was not easy to become a franchise team.  The redskins owner, George Preston Marshall made it quite difficult since he had a monopoly over AFC for decades.  The way they got Marshall to allow the team to be franchised is by threating him by not allowing him to play "Hail to the Redskins"</p>
